Exercise Tracking Automation with Nutrition API & Sheety

This Python project automatically tracks workouts by converting natural language exercise input into structured fitness data. It uses the Nutritionix Natural Exercise API to analyze exercises and calculate duration and calories burned, then logs the results into a Google Sheet via the Sheety API. The application securely manages credentials using environment variables and records each workout with the current date and time. It’s designed as a simple but practical example of API integration, HTTP requests with requests, and real-world automation for fitness tracking.
Key features:
Natural language exercise input, Calorie and duration calculation via Nutritionix API, Automatic logging to Google Sheets using Sheety, Secure API key handling with environment variables, Ideal for learning API consumption, data logging, and automation in Python.
